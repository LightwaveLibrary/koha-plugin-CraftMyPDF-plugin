This is a Koha ILS plugin that allows generating PDF reports via a button from your Koha reports module. Using CraftMyPDF's report builders, you can now design fancy re-usable PDF Templates. This will require an account with CraftMyPdf.com

# Q: Who is this for?
This is for the report builder enthusiast.  If you have any previous report building experience in a graphical IDE, such as MS SQL REPORTS or Crystal Reports, this will be right up your alley. 

# Q: Is CraftMyPDF free?
Yes.  You can get started on free plans with the above mentioned sites. Of course with anything, if you want to use any of these services heavily, you will need to upgrade to a basic service plan.  CraftMyPDF has a free tier that allows up to 3 report templates and 50 executions per month.  This will be more than enough for providing state or board members, complex annual reports, as an example.

# LET'S GET STARTED
In these examples, I will be using Make.com and craftmypdf.com for these illustrated steps.
